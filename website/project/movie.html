                            corrupt and brutal underworld of Manila. This landmark film explores themes of poverty, exploitation,

                            <br> A must mandatory watch one of the internationally praised, critically acclaimed

                        <p>Based on the real life case reported by the great National Artist Nick Joacquin, 
                            the film narrates about a controlling father who becomes obsessively 
                            fixated on his daughter after intense family conflicts. <br> 
                            Such controversies and changes away from the real events,
                            the film explores themes of control, paranoia, and the destructive 
                            effects of authority and repression within a family, which metaphorically reflects
                         the political societies during the dictatorial regimes of the 70's.
                        Coming from as cinematographer of the great Lino Brocka, this landmark film became the relevant
                , cautionary tale. A must watch.</p>

                            fighting for survival against ruthless criminals. <br>
                            Such inconsistent camera work, over-the-top action-packed performance,
                            and one of the unrealistically most killed extras, most death tolls, one of the highest body counts in Philippine cinema in just 
                            one location, it highlights themes of 
                            corruption and the brutal realities of the drug war. A critique of the terrible
                             anti-drug war campaign.

                            Based on the novel by Bob Ong, the story follows a young man named Galo who

                         Garcia, the film missed the opportunity to execute, failed to convert the
                         novel to film, full of misinterpretation and not very impactful unlike the beloved 
                         <i>ABNKKBSNPla Ako</i>. Not a terrible one, but a weak one.
